This is just a repo I set up to stop live editing my website, because that was probably poor practice.
This project uses node.js to host my website which can be found on the web [here](https://www.greatgamegal.com).
Certbot was used to generate certificates for use on the webhosting service, certbot and instructions to use it can be found [here](https://certbot.eff.org/).
